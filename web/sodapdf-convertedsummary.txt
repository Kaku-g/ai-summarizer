 the acronym MEMS is used to d escribe this type of microrobots . a common way to obtain miniaturization is by using MEMS technologies ( i.e.,MEMS for making microrobotes) the term microrobotics gathers knowledge from various disciplines, including physics at the microscale and adhesion . the design objective is to de ne actuating principles with suf ciently high force-to-volume ratio to produce a motion .
