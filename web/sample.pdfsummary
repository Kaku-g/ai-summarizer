 a growing interest in manufacturing technologies other than the integrated cir- cuit (IC)-inspired silicon wafer and batch MEMs fabrication is evident in the microsystem field today . the acronym MEMS is used to describe this type of microrobots .a common way to obtain miniaturization is by using MEMS technologies (i.e.,MEMS for making microrobotes) the term microrobotics cov- ers several different types of small robot devices and systems .the sapphire substrate and heats up a at solder bump .microrobotics is an engineering discipline that is intrinsically multidisci- plinary . it gathers knowledge from various disciplines, including physics at the microscale and adhesion . microrobots are aiming at interacting with micro- 1objects and test distributed intelligence algorithms . the design objective is to de ne actuating principles with suf ciently high force-to-volume ratio to produce a motion
